## About

Hi! I am Youzhe Liu (刘有哲). Right now, I am a Ph.D. student in University of California, Riverside, advised by Professor [Yan Gu](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~ygu/) and [Yihan Sun](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~yihans/). I earned my B.S. in Applied Statistics and Data Science from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).

## Research

My current research focuses on designing parallel algorithms with theoretical guanrantee and pratical implementations, especially graph algorithms and clustering.
